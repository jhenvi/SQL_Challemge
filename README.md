Employee Data Base
 
Data Modeling, Data Engineering and Data Analysis of an Employee DB using PostgreSQL

DATA MODELLING
To map different relationships in the data base I drew the schemas using  the http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com.
DATA INGENEERING
I reviewed information and created a table schema for each of the six data files. Specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints. Imported csv files to a SQL database to its respective tables. 
DATA ANALYSIS
SQL folder with query analysis that provide the following results:
- Details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.
- Employees who were hired in 1986.
- Manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name,   first name, and start and end employment dates.
- Department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- Employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
- Employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- Employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- In descending order, the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
